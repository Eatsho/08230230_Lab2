    <h2>Timeline of My Educational Journey</h2>
    <ul class="timeline">
      <li><strong>Age 5.5:</strong> Began my schooling at Shachapang Primary School in the serene village of Rawabi, Lhuentse Dzongkha, a hidden gem that later closed its doors due to a lack of students.</li>
      <li><strong>Early School Years:</strong> Transitioned to Kuzhugchen Middle Secondary School for almost a year, followed by two years at Dotha Lower Secondary School in Paro, where I explored life and agriculture amidst the lush landscapes.</li>
      <li><strong>Grade 5:</strong> Completed fifth grade at Shaba Primary School, Paro.</li>
      <li><strong>High School:</strong> My family relocated to Phuentsholing, where I joined Phuentsholing Higher Secondary School. Here, I spent my high school years growing both academically and personally.</li>
      <li><strong>2019 – COVID-19:</strong> Relocated to Khuruthang, Punakha. Learned resilience and independence.</li>
      <li><strong>Present:</strong> Pursuing Bachelor in Secondary Education at Samtse College of Education.</li>
